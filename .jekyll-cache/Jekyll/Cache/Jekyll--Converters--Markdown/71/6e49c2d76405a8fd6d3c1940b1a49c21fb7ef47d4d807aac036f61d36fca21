I"¹<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Will Larry. Iâ€™m a cajun food loving, sports enthusiast, who discovered the world of software developing and programming and have never been the same the since.</p>

<p>Problem solving is my passion and as much as I can crush a 5,000 piece puzzle with the best of them, Iâ€™ve long been in search for a way to use my logical, structured based mind in a life-long career.</p>

<p>I recently quit my job as a operations manager because my wife received a promotion, which relocated us to Kansas City. Three months of unemployment taught me a lot about myself. First, I hate not working. Secondly, I am passionate about helping people/companies by working on projects that require creativity, logic and have a tangible, end-result. As I spoke to a friend about exploring new career paths, he suggested software development and programming.</p>

<p>I began to research development bootcamps and discovered this skill set opened the door to hundreds of different career opportunities. Not only could I do something that was challenging and fun, but I could also help companies achieve their goals by creating functional, dependable, products/websites. I began searching for a program providing a well-rounded, thorough, knowledge base of Software Development and Programming. With the weekly, one-on-one mentoring, assignments that work towards building a portfolio, and job placement record, the Bloc bootcamp stood head and shoulders above the rest.</p>
