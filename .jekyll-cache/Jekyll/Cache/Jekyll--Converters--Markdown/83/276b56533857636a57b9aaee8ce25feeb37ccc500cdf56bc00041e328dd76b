I"9<p>It has been a couple of weeks since the beginning of Bloc apprenticeship. I guess it is true when people say time flies when you are having fun. I cannot believe how much I have learned during this time. I’m neck deep in HTML and CSS. It amazes me that all websites start with HTMl and CSS. I’m having to adjust to a different method of learning. In the apprenticeship, I have a mentor that answers any questions that I may have. They structure it this way to model the way you will learn if you were a junior developer at a company. Time to get back to it.</p>
