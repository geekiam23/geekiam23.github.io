## Explanation

Bloc Jams is a completely practical music player, developed first with JavaScript, then recreated with jQuery and AngularJS. Some of Bloc Jamsâ€™ most important features include the ability to replay, skip, and mute songs. Buzz library was used to support music playback (along with a variety of other functions).
 
## Problem
 
Bloc Jams is a browser-only replica of Spotify. The website has three pages - landing page for information, a collection page that was used to accumulate available albums on one page to select, and an album page where users could listen to an album. The player bar, located at the bottom of the album page, lets users have control over the album that is currently playing.
