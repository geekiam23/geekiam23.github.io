title: Where It All Began
---

Hi, I’m Will Larry. I’m a cajun food loving, sports enthusiast, who discovered the world of software developing and programming and have never been the same the since.

Problem solving is my passion and as much as I can crush a 5,000 piece puzzle with the best of them, I’ve long been in search for a way to use my logical, structured based mind in a life-long career.

I recently quit my job as a operations manager because my wife received a promotion, which relocated us to Kansas City. Three months of unemployment taught me a lot about myself. First, I hate not working. Secondly, I am passionate about helping people/companies by working on projects that require creativity, logic and have a tangible, end-result. As I spoke to a friend about exploring new career paths, he suggested software development and programming.

I began to research development bootcamps and discovered this skill set opened the door to hundreds of different career opportunities. Not only could I do something that was challenging and fun, but I could also help companies achieve their goals by creating functional, dependable, products/websites. I began searching for a program providing a well-rounded, thorough, knowledge base of Software Development and Programming. With the weekly, one-on-one mentoring, assignments that work towards building a portfolio, and job placement record, the Bloc bootcamp stood head and shoulders above the rest.
